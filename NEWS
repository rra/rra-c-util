                     User-Visible rra-c-util Changes

rra-c-util 9.1 (unreleased)

    Fix portable k_haspag replacement to not attempt to allocate negative
    memory if getgroups fails.  Thanks, Jeffrey Altman.

rra-c-util 9.0 (2021-03-20)

    Rename all SQLite Autoconf macros from SQLITE to SQLITE3, including
    their output variables and configure command-line options, to bring
    the naming convention in line with common practice for software using
    SQLite v3.  Clear the SQLITE3 variables if the library was optional
    and no working library was found.

    Rename the KRB5_CPPFLAGS_GCC output variable from the RRA_LIB_KRB5
    macro to KRB5_CPPFLAGS_WARNINGS to more accurately reflect its
    intended use and to reflect that it works with Clang.

    The m4/krb5.m4 Autoconf macros no longer define AM_CONDITIONAL as a
    no-op if it's not already defined, since this may be unexpected when
    loading a macro.  If you want to use those macros without Automake,
    add m4_define_default([AM_CONDITIONAL], [:]) to configure.ac.

    The RRA_LIB_KRB5 and RRA_LIB_KRB5_OPTIONAL macros now also check that
    at least one Kerberos header file was found and either abort with an
    error or mark Kerberos as unusable depending on the choice of macro.
    Thanks, Julien ÉLIE.

    Add C stubs for sd_notify and sd_notifyf and a (non-functional)
    preprocessor stub for sd_is_socket for portability for more APIs to
    systems without libsystemd.

    Fix portable/sd-daemon.h to include necessary prerequisite headers and
    not assume they were already included.

    Fix the RRA_PROG_PYTHON Python version test to work on Python 3.0 and
    Python versions older than 2.7.  Tested with Python 2.3.0.  Thanks,
    Julien ÉLIE.

    Fix the util/fdflag test on Solaris 11.  Thanks, Julien ÉLIE.

    Fix some bogus networking assumptions made by the util/fdflag test
    that caused it to fail on OpenBSD, and clean up the child process if
    anything goes wrong with the main process so that the test driver
    doesn't hang.

    Use AS_ECHO instead of echo in all Autoconf macros for slightly
    improved portability.  Thanks, Julien ÉLIE.

    Allow use of package variables from YAML::XS when running perlcritic.

rra-c-util 8.4 (2020-12-13)

    Add a new RRA_PROG_LD_FLAG Autoconf macro to probe whether a given
    flag is supported when linking.  Patch from Julien ÉLIE.

    Allow the RRA_PROG_C_FLAG Autoconf macro to be used to probe for flags
    containing a comma.  Change suggested by Julien ÉLIE.

    Include string.h in the probe for AI_ADDRCONFIG support to avoid
    problems on macOS X.  Thanks, Bo Lindbergh.

    NetBSD prefers reallocarr to reallocarray and only prototypes the
    latter if _OPENBSD_SOURCE is defined, which is not one of the macros
    Autoconf defines by default.  Work around this for now by checking
    whether reallocarray is declared, not only whether it's available, and
    protyping it if it's not declared.  This uses the semi-hidden
    deprecated symbol on NetBSD.

    In the getnameinfo replacement, handle musl libc's gethostbyaddr,
    which returns the string conversion of the IP address if the host
    doesn't resolve.  This only affects the test suite, since musl libc
    supports IPv6 and thus doesn't need this replacement.

    Add a more explicit statement of backward compatibility support,
    namely that support for systems released more than fifteen years ago
    will be dropped if that support becomes burdensome.

rra-c-util 8.3 (2020-08-09)

    Stop providing a replacement for a broken snprintf and assume the libc
    version works correctly.  This portability code has proven difficult
    to maintain, and was only relevant for ancient proprietary UNIX
    versions that have been obsolete for many years.

    Fix network tests on hosts with no IPv4 addresses.  In this case, the
    network tests for binding all configured addresses will bind only to
    IPv6, which broke some prior assumptions in the test suite.  Thanks to
    Niko Tyni for the bug report.

    Ignore files named changelog when checking for obsolete strings so
    that the check will not trigger on old Debian changelog entries.

    Suppress ControlStructures::ProhibitCascadingIfElse in perlcritic
    checks.  It recommends using given/when instead, but this construct is
    marked as experimental in Perl and was considered a mistake in some
    quarters.

    Fix style issues found in Perl code by Perl::Critic::Freenode and
    install it as part of CI testing.  This avoids issues with reusing the
    Perl tests with Perl modules tested with perl-tester Docker images,
    which pre-install those Perl::Critic policies.

rra-c-util 8.2 (2020-05-16)

    Use memset to implement explicit_bzero if the latter is not
    available.

    Fix support for configuring Kerberos tests with their own krb5.conf
    file.  Patch from Jeffrey Hutzelman.

    Fix support for configuring Kerberos tests when the system krb5.conf
    file does not contain a default_realm setting.

    Change ENTRY and EXIT logging macros for PAM modules to use do/while
    syntax so that it can be used like a function call.

    Add a definition of PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE to portable/pam.h.

    Ignore files in tests/config other than README when checking for SPDX
    license identifiers.

    Skip directories named .pc when enumerating all files for tests and
    when checking for SPDX license identifiers for Perl packages.  This
    directory is used by quilt (and thus some Debian packaging) for
    metadata.

    Ignore object files when checking for SPDX license identifiers.

    Fix header ordering in some of the portability socket code to restore
    compatibility with some ancient UNIX systems.  This was broken by the
    include reordering done by clang-format.  Thanks, Julien ÉLIE.

    Fix warnings with Clang 10.

    Update to C TAP Harness 4.7:

    * Fix warning with GCC 10.

rra-c-util 8.1 (2020-01-05)

    Drop support for Perl 5.6.  Perl tests and supporting libraries now
    require Perl 5.8 or later.  Not even CPAN testers are still testing
    Perl 5.6 and Travis-CI doesn't support it, so true support was dubious
    at best.  Dropping support for Perl 5.6 allows cleaning up some old
    compatibility code.

    Reformat all C source using clang-format 10 and the formatting rules
    specified in .clang-format.

    Update suppressions and fix issues found by cppcheck 1.89.

    Remove snprintf tests that surpassed the promised precision of C
    floating point numbers.

rra-c-util 8.0 (2019-09-01)

    Test::RRA now must be imported before Test::More, and will check
    whether Test::More is available and skip the whole test if it is not
    (such as Red Hat systems with perl but not perl-core installed).  All
    included tests written in Perl have been updated to import Test::RRA
    before Test::More.

    The is_file_contents Test::RRA function now falls back on printing the
    expected and seen output if diff does not work, primarily to support
    platforms like Windows with no standard diff program.

    Fix RRA_LIB_KRB5_OPTIONAL probing in the --enable-reduced-depends case
    when linking with libkrb5 is not possible but libcom_err is present.
    The probes for com_err were previously not skipped, resulting in a
    non-empty KRB5_LIBS containing only -lcom_err, which incorrectly
    caused the macro to indicate that Kerberos libraries were present.

    Work around Test::Strict not skipping .git directories by testing an
    explicit list of files and directories in the Perl t/style/strict.t
    test.  This means that test now assumes the only interesting files are
    in subdirectories or end in *.PL.  It also now skips blib, so no
    longer double-checks library files and scripts.

    Don't erroneously exclude Build.PL files from SPDX license identifier
    checks in Perl packages.

    In tests/docs/spdx-license-t and the Perl equivalent, check for my
    legacy "see LICENSE" notice even in short files that are otherwise
    skipped by the test to ensure that all license notices are replaced
    with the new SPDX notices.

    Ignore Changes when checking Perl files for obsolete strings.

    rra-c-util now tests the Perl test utilities that it includes, and
    therefore builds and tests a dummy Perl module during its build.
    Therefore, Perl 5.6.2 or later and the Module::Build module are now
    required to build rra-c-util (but not to use its components).

    Minor updates to fix warnings and tests with GCC 9.2.1, perltidy
    20190601, and Perl::Critic 1.134.

    Update to C TAP Harness 4.5:

    * New test_cleanup_register_with_data function.
    * Fixed malloc error checking in bstrndup.
    * New bcalloc_type and breallocarray_type utility functions.
    * Fix (harmless) allocation error in runtests driver.

rra-c-util 7.2 (2018-06-03)

    Add new Python Autoconf macros RRA_PROG_PYTHON, RRA_PYTHON_MODULE, and
    RRA_LIB_PYTHON written by Julien ÉLIE and based on earlier work in
    INN.  The first finds Python through an environment variable or a PATH
    search, checking for a sufficiently high version, and supports
    requiring Python 2, Python 3, or either.  The second checks whether a
    Python module can be loaded by the discovered Python interpreter, and
    the third reports the flags required to link with the Python library
    to embed it in another program.

    The Autoconf RRA_PROG_PERL macro now also makes PERL a substitution
    variable.  Thanks, Julien ÉLIE.

    The Autoconf RRA_LIB_PERL macro now checks for the EXTERN.h header and
    for perl_alloc in the libperl library, to double-check that the
    discovered linkage information actually works.  (It may not on, for
    example, a Debian host without libperl-dev installed.)

    The Autoconf RRA_LIB_BDB, RRA_LIB_OPENSSL, RRA_LIB_SASL, and
    RRA_LIB_ZLIB macros, and their _OPTIONAL counterparts, all now check
    that the library's key header can be found as well as the library.
    The _OPTIONAL versions treat the library as missing if the header is
    not present; the non-optional versions will abort configure with an
    error if the header is not present.

    Rename the docs/urls test (for both Perl and non-Perl packages) to
    style/obsolete-strings, which more correctly reflects its purpose.
    Add a check for RRA_MAINTAINER_TESTS, which has been replaced by
    Lancaster Consensus environment variables.

    Fix updating of Perl module versions using the new-style package
    syntax by tests/perl/module-version-t -u.  Previous versions were
    quoting two-part version numbers, but this is a syntax error when the
    version is set with the package directive.

    Skip more Automake files in the all_files function of
    Test::RRA::Automake.

    Add more exclusions to the spdx-license tests.

rra-c-util 7.1 (2018-05-06)

    Fix misplaced va_end in the pam-util putil_log_failure function.

    Avoid testing the client IP address when accepting TCP and UDP client
    connections using network_bind_all.  Some hosts with unusual network
    configurations may rewrite client packets to appear to come from an IP
    address other than 127.0.0.1, resulting in false positives in earlier
    versions of this test.

    Add maintainer check-cppcheck target to run cppcheck across the source
    base with a standard configuration.  Fix all issues found by cppcheck.

    Skip checking for krb5-config on the path if an install prefix was
    provided to the corresponding configure flag.  This was harmless but
    resulted in confusing output.

    Define UINT32_MAX for systems that don't have it.

    Switch the license of the essentially public domain source files from
    a license statement I borrowed from the IETF to a more standard FSF
    all-permissive license.

    Add SPDX-License-Identifier headers to all substantial source files,
    and add a test to check for them.

    Skip more Autoconf and Automake files in the all_files function of
    Test::RRA::Automake.

    Rework the check-valgrind target to use the new C TAP Harness valgrind
    support and automatically check the valgrind log files for errors at
    the end of the test suite.

    Add support for running remctld under valgrind when spawning it for
    test cases.

    Update perlcriticrc for Perl tests to disable a false positive on
    postfix dereferencing and allow package variables in another module.

    Update to C TAP Harness 4.3:

    * Add support for valgrind testing via test list options.
    * Report test failures as left and right, not wanted and seen.
    * Fix is_string comparisons involving NULL pointers and "(null)".
    * Add SPDX-License-Identifier headers to all substantial source files.

rra-c-util 7.0 (2017-12-30)

    Drop the SA_LEN macro from portable/socket.h.  This macro came from
    INN's portability code, and can be useful when adding IPv6 support to
    old code bases that didn't pass address lengths.  But it was fairly
    easy to remove the remaining uses of it from INN, and it's never
    caught on and been standardized.  It wasn't necessary in any of my
    other projects and was causing warnings with some new warning options
    in GCC 7, so drop it entirely.

    network_sockaddr_sprint takes a socklen_t instead of a size_t as its
    second argument for better compatibility with other networking
    functions it calls.

    Allow bail_krb5 and diag_krb5 TAP library functions to take either a
    krb5_error_code or a kadm5_ret_t as their second argument.

    Fix new warnings in GCC 7.  Add -Wformat-overflow=2,
    -Wformat-truncation=2, -Walloc-zero, -Wduplicated-branches,
    -Wconversion -Wno-sign-conversion, -Wmissing-declarations, and
    -Wrestrict to the default GCC warning flags, and fix resulting issues.
    Remove various warning options that are now the default or implied by
    other flags.

    Fix all warnings from the Clang static analyzer.  Ensure that
    allocations in reallocarray replacements have a minimum size of 1 and
    that pam-util/vector.c always allocates the strings array with a
    minimum size of 1 to simplify static analysis.

    Flesh out support for Clang warnings and compile cleanly under Clang
    with most warnings enabled (-Weverything with some exclusions).  See
    m4/cc-flags.m4 for the list of Clang warning options excluded.

    Support testing flags containing + characters using RRA_PROG_CC_FLAG.
    This character has to be replaced when creating cache variables.
    Thanks to Julien ÉLIE for the report.

    Update valgrind configuration to exclude more false positives from MIT
    and Heimdal libraries doing load-time allocations.

    Update to C TAP Harness 4.2:

    * Add is_blob and is_bool functions to the C test library.
    * Avoid zero-length realloc allocations in breallocarray.

rra-c-util 6.2 (2016-12-24)

    Correctly handle -Wno-* options in RRA_PROG_CC_FLAG.  GCC and Clang
    both don't produce fatal errors for unknown -Wno-* flags, so test the
    corresponding positive -W flag instead when determining if they're
    supported.  Thanks to Guillem Jover for the information.

    In RRA_PROG_CC_WARNINGS_FLAGS, always add -Werror to warning flags for
    both GCC and Clang, rather than probing for whether it's supported in
    GCC and not using it with Clang.

    Add new is_file_contents function to Test::RRA for Perl tests.  This
    compares a string with the contents of a file and displays a diff if
    they don't match.

    Add a new test (tests/docs/urls-t, and perl/t/docs/urls.t for Perl
    modules) for bad URLs or other strings in all distribution files,
    initially just checking for non-https www.eyrie.org URLs and my old
    email address.  In the process, add a new all_files function to
    Test::RRA::Automake that returns all "interesting" files in the
    distribution that a test may want to look at.

    Require version 0.25 of Test::Strict or later in tests/perl/strict-t
    and perl/t/style/strict.t, since that version is required to know that
    use 5.012 or later automatically implies use strict.

rra-c-util 6.1 (2016-10-10)

    Correct the return-value checks for snprintf to avoid an off-by-one
    error when verifying the output was not truncated.  (All locations
    should have been safe anyway for other reasons, but be certain.)
    Based on a patch by Yuriy M. Kaminskiy to INN.

    New RRA_PROG_CC_FLAG macro, from INN, which determines whether the
    compiler supports a given flag.  New RRA_PROG_CC_WARNINGS_FLAGS macro,
    replacing the WARNINGS variable in Makefile.am, to calculate all of
    the warning flags supported by the current compiler, and use it for
    the make warnings target.  The warning flags have been updated for new
    flags available in GCC 6.1.0.

    Test::RRA::Config could not load perl.conf when run outside the test
    suite under current Perl (5.22.2) because the semantics of "do" with
    relative paths changed.  Fix by making the relative search paths more
    explicit.  This fixes running module-version-t -u outside the test
    suite to bump version numbers.

rra-c-util 6.0 (2016-05-07)

    Rewrite vector_join and cvector_join to use memcpy instead of strlcpy
    and strlcat.

    Remove the portable replacements for strlcat and strlcpy.  These had
    various bugs around edge cases, and I've been convinced that these
    interfaces are a bad idea.  They're no longer used by any of the
    utility libraries and should normally be replaced with asprintf or
    similar functions.

    network_set_freebind, network_set_reuseaddr, and network_set_v6only
    are now public functions for clients that need additional control over
    when these options are set or can't use the network_bind functions.

    Fix the m4/openssl.m4 probe for OpenSSL to look for SSL_accept instead
    of SSL_library_init, fixing OpenSSL 1.1.0 detection.  Thanks, Julien
    ÉLIE.

    Add a new RRA_PROG_PERL macro that finds the path of a Perl
    interpreter of the given version or newer.  Add a new
    RRA_PERL_CHECK_MODULE macro that checks whether a given module can be
    loaded by Perl.  Add a new RRA_LIB_PERL macro that finds the compiler
    and linker flags for embedding Perl.  These are based on the configure
    macros used in INN.

    Add a replacement for gss_oid_equal for older versions of Heimdal.

    Use C_TAP_SOURCE and C_TAP_BUILD environment variables in all test
    support code instead of SOURCE and BUILD, following the change in C
    TAP Harness 4.0.  Upgrading to any test support libraries from this
    release will also require upgrading the test suite driver to C TAP
    Harness 4.0 or later.

    Rename the script to bootstrap from a Git checkout to bootstrap,
    matching the emerging consensus in the Autoconf world.

rra-c-util 5.10 (2016-01-17)

    New option, @MODULE_VERSION_IGNORE, for the test perl.conf
    configuration that excludes certain modules from the version
    consistency check.  This allows different versioning to be used for
    modules that provide DBIx::Class schemata.

    Move common code between tests/perl/module-version-t and
    perl/t/style/module-version.t into a new Test::RRA::ModuleVersion test
    module.  This adds support for the Perl 5.12 module version syntax to
    the tests/perl/module-version-t version of the test.

    Fix the Perl docs/synopsis.t test to not use UNIX-specific path
    delimiters to exclude files in blib/script.  This fixes portability to
    older builds of Perl on Windows.

    The util/network/server-t test has been made more robust against
    additional ways that IPv6 could not be available, such as the
    restrictions in the current Travis-CI build environment.

rra-c-util 5.9 (2015-11-27)

    Fix the portability defines for the anonymous principal strings to
    correctly define the Heimdal API, and add KRB5_ANON_REALM.

    In the PAM testing framework, clear errno when a module calls
    pam_modutil_getpwnam with an unrecognized username.  Returning NULL
    with a 0 errno makes other testing easier.

    Add PAM_SESSION_ERR to the error codes supported by the PAM testing
    framework.

rra-c-util 5.8 (2015-08-18)

    Add missing va_end in xasprintf implementation.

    Fix segfault in buffer_find_string if passed a buffer that's never had
    any data.  Found by Richard Kettlewell.

    Add portability code for kadm5_init_krb5_context for programs that
    use libkadm5clnt without needing libkrb5.

    Fix the logic in Test::RRA::Automake for stripping relative
    directories from the paths created by Automake to cope with multiple
    ascending relative paths in a row, as is now used by current Automake
    dist checking.

    Update to C TAP Harness 3.4:

    * Fix segfault in runtests with an empty test list.

rra-c-util 5.7 (2015-04-26)

    Add portability defines for Mac OS X 10's PAM implementation, which
    doesn't support the PAM_DATA_REPLACE and PAM_DATA_SILENT options for
    pam_set_data and doesn't define PAM_BAD_ITEM.  Thanks to Meno Abels
    for the report.

    Add new RRA_HEADER_PAM_STRERROR_CONST macro that checks whether
    pam_strerror wants its first argument declared const.  This is
    required to build the fakepam library for testing on Mac OS X, which
    declares the first argument const (unlike other PAM implementations).

    Avoid $() in the probe for systemd support, since Solaris 10 /bin/sh
    is still used by configure and doesn't support this syntax.

    Prefer libsystemd to libsystemd-daemon if it is available, since
    upstream merged the systemd libraries together.  The macro is still
    called RRA_LIB_SYSTEMD_DAEMON_OPTIONAL for now, since it only checks
    for those functions and will support libsystemd-daemon on older
    installations.

    Port the Kerberos Autoconf macros and portability framework to the
    included Kerberos in Solaris 10 by adding some more entries to the
    header search paths.

    Add a macro to probe for whether the compiler is Clang, and use that
    to determine appropriate warning flags for Clang versus gcc.

    Update to C TAP Harness 3.3:

    * Display verbose test results with -v or C_TAP_VERBOSE.
    * Test infrastructure builds cleanly with Clang warnings.

rra-c-util 5.6 (2014-12-25)

    Check for integer overflow when determining the size of the results of
    vector_join and vector_cjoin.

    Avoid strlcpy in the getnameinfo replacement (use memcpy instead) and
    the setenv replacement (use asprintf instead).

    Add a style/module-version.t test and helper script for regular Perl
    modules.  This is similar to tests/perl/module-version-t except that
    it expects a Perl module layout instead of Perl modules embedded in a
    larger distribution, does not do the Automake integration, and
    supports the Perl 5.12 package syntax.  (Common code should someday be
    factored out into Test::RRA.)

    Fix visibility for util/buffer.c functions and for inet_aton and
    inet_ntoa replacements to match the default hidden visibility of other
    portability and util functions.  Thanks, Julien ÉLIE.

    network_addr_match now always fails (returns false) if either of the
    strings are the empty string.  AIX 7.1's inet_aton treats the empty
    string as equivalent to 0.0.0.0, but we want to treat it as a syntax
    error since it's too easy to get an empty string by accident.

    network_connect, network_connect_host, and network_client_create now
    accept "any" as a source as well as "all", as a synonym for letting
    the operating system pick, for parallelism with network_bind_ipv4 and
    network_bind_ipv6.

    The portable/socket.h portability layer now provides a
    socket_set_errno_einval() macro to set the current socket error to an
    equivalent of EINVAL.  Windows uses a different error code for this
    case.

    There is a new portable/socket-unix.h portability layer that includes
    sys/un.h and defines SUN_LEN if the implementation does not do so.
    (Use in combination with the RRA_MACRO_SUN_LEN Autoconf macro.)

    Add PIPE_READ and PIPE_WRITE macros to util/macros.h to name the
    elements of the array passed to pipe.

    Add full support for PAM_RHOST, PAM_RUSER, and PAM_TTY and read-only
    support for PAM_SERVICE (returning the service name given to
    pam_start) and PAM_USER_PROMPT (returning "login: ") to the fake PAM
    library for testing.  Patch from Jeffrey Hutzelman.

    In the TAP add-on for Kerberos testing, add a new flag,
    TAP_KRB_NEEDS_PKINIT, to the kerberos_setup function.  This indicates
    that configuration for PKINIT authentications is required for this
    test case.

    Update to C TAP Harness 3.2:

    * Support comments and blank lines in test lists.

rra-c-util 5.5 (2014-07-02)

    In network_read and network_write with a timeout, restart the I/O
    attempt if a system call failed with EINTR instead of aborting the
    operation.

    Use calloc in preference to calculating a malloc size with
    multiplication everywhere, and reallocarray in preference to
    calculating a realloc size.  In most places this caution was probably
    not necessary, but uniformity is easier to audit and no one will ever
    notice the speed difference between malloc and calloc.

    Add a replacement for reallocarray for systems (currently anything
    that isn't OpenBSD) that don't have it.  This function is the same as
    realloc but takes calloc-style arguments and checks for size overflow
    before calling realloc.

    Add xreallocarray to the util library, which is a checked version of
    reallocarray similar to what xrealloc is for realloc.

    portable/system.h now also guarantees the inclusion of inttypes.h
    (which it had included for years as an implementation detail) and
    limits.h (to ensure the availability of SIZE_TYPE on older systems).

    Fix compilation of portable/pam.h with a C++ compiler.  Caught by
    cppcheck.

    RRA_LIB_KRB5 and RRA_LIB_KRB5_OPTIONAL now also provide a
    KRB5_CPPFLAGS_GCC Makefile variable that can be used in combination
    with gcc warnings (such as the make warnings target) to suppress
    warnings from Kerberos headers in non-system paths.

    The util/messages-krb5 test can now be included in a package that may
    or may not be built with Kerberos support and will be skipped if
    Kerberos support is not enabled.

    Update to C TAP Harness 3.1:

    * ok, okv, and is_* now return the success of the test.
    * diag and sysdiag now return true.
    * Add breallocarray API for error-checked reallocarray in tests.
    * Check for integer overflow on memory allocations.
    * Avoid all remaining uses of sprintf.

rra-c-util 5.4 (2014-03-25)

    Rename skip_unless_maintainer to skip_unless_author in Test::RRA and
    add a skip_unless_automated function that skips the test unless
    author, release, or automated testing is requested.  Use the new
    function for many of the Perl tests that don't uncover functionality
    issues.  Switch from RRA_MAINTAINER_TESTS to use the environment
    variables from the Perl Lancaster Consensus (AUTHOR_TESTING,
    AUTOMATED_TESTING, and RELEASE_TESTING) for consistency with other
    Perl packages.

    Add Autoconf support for SQLite in the form of RRA_LIB_SQLITE and
    RRA_LIB_SQLITE_OPTIONAL macros and corresponding RRA_LIB_SQLITE_SWITCH
    and RRA_LIB_SQLITE_RESTORE macros.  These only look for SQLite 3 with
    the sqlite3_open_v2 interface, since that should be old enough to be
    present nearly everywhere.

rra-c-util 5.3 (2014-03-18)

    The standard Perl script test for strict and warnings now supports a
    new configuration option, @STRICT_PREREQ, which lists modules that are
    required for meaningful script testing.  If any of those modules is
    not installed, Perl scripts will not be checked.  This allows correct
    handling of supporting scripts or optional utilities whose
    dependencies are not installed when tests are run.

    Work around a bug caused by the combination of Perl::Tidy 20130922,
    which unconditionally writes a log file, and Perl::Critic, which
    doesn't suppress it, by removing stray perltidy.LOG files after
    testing.

    Skip Perl critic tests for right now if the source directory is not
    writable, since Perl::Tidy 20130922 tries to unconditionally create a
    log file in the current directory, the current directory needs to be
    the root of the source directory for some testing to work properly,
    and Perl::Tidy fails all checks if it cannot create the log file.

rra-c-util 5.2 (2014-01-28)

    Suppress shell errors from the systemd unit directory probe when
    pkg-config is not available.

    Add Autoconf support for libevent in the form of RRA_LIB_EVENT and
    RRA_LIB_EVENT_OPTIONAL macros and corresponding RRA_LIB_EVENT_SWITCH
    and RRA_LIB_EVENT_RESTORE macros.  Add a portability wrapper around
    the libevent include files and Autoconf probes, defines, and code to
    support using libevent 1.4 via the libevent 2.0 API (with some
    degradation of functionality).

    Add new message_handlers_reset function to the messages utility API.
    This function resets all handlers to their defaults and frees any
    memory allocated by the message_handlers functions.  This is primarily
    useful to allow freeing all memory when doing exhaustive memory
    allocation testing.

    In the process TAP add-on, flush output from the process after
    stopping it instead of before and include the exit status if
    available.  Use a cleaner method to wait for the process to stop that
    doesn't terminate the test with SIGALRM if the process doesn't stop
    fast enough and instead clearly reports the problem with bail.  Fix a
    memory leak when starting a process under fakeroot.

    Port the Kerberos TAP add-on to the new test_cleanup_register API and
    free allocated memory in child processes as well as the primary
    process.

    Fix syntax error when building portable/krb5.h with a C++ compiler.

    Add additional suppressions for MIT Kerberos and Heimdal to the
    valgrind suppression file.

    Update to C TAP Harness 3.0:

    * test_cleanup_register callbacks now know about the primary process.
    * Reopen standard input to /dev/null when running a test list.
    * Don't leak extraneous file descriptors to tests.

rra-c-util 5.1 (2014-01-05)

    Fix a cut and paste error that prevented process_start_fakeroot from
    working properly.

    Add Autoconf support for systemd.  This provides two macros:
    RRA_WITH_SYSTEMD_UNITDIR, which defines the HAVE_SYSTEMD Automake
    conditional and the systemdsystemunitdir substitution variable, and
    RRA_LIB_SYSTEMD_DAEMON_OPTIONAL, which probes for the optional
    libsystemd-daemon library (used for socket notification and startup
    synchronization).  It also provides portable/sd-daemon.h, which wraps
    the systemd/sd-daemon.h include file and stubs out sd_notify and
    sd_listen_fds if libsystemd-daemon was not available.

rra-c-util 5.0 (2013-12-27)

    The network_bind_* functions now take a socket type as an additional
    argument so that they can be used with UDP-based services.

    network_bind_all now returns a boolean, which will be false if no
    sockets could be bound due to some error.  Callers may check this
    instead of checking if the socket count is zero.

    The network_bind_* functions now more reliably set the socket errno on
    failure and log somewhat more informative error messages with warn.

    New network_wait_any function that waits for an array of file
    descriptors and returns the first one that selects ready for read.
    This can be used by UDP servers similar to network_accept_any for TCP
    servers.

    vector_free and cvector_free now accept a NULL argument and silently
    do nothing.  This allows for more concise cleanup code.

    Provide new process_start, process_start_fakeroot, and process_stop
    functions in the process TAP add-on.  Note that these require an
    Autoconf probe for sys/select.h and a replacement for a missing
    mkstemp.  Rewrite the remctl TAP add-on to use this new API to start
    and stop remctld.

    The remctl TAP add-on now aborts if the remctld PID file already
    exists rather than removing it and continuing.  Since the process is
    automatically stopped and the PID file removed on any normal test
    exit, its continued existence probably implies there's a random
    remctld process still running.

    Add new RRA_LIB_ZLIB and RRA_LIB_ZLIB_OPTIONAL macros to probe for
    zlib, based on the Autoconf macros in INN.  Contributed by Julien
    ÉLIE.

    Add new RRA_LIB_BDB, RRA_LIB_BDB_OPTIONAL, and RRA_LIB_BDB_NDBM macros
    to probe for Berkeley DB and its ndbm compatibility layer, based on
    the Autoconf macros in INN.  Contributed by Julien ÉLIE.

    Update to C TAP Harness 2.4:

    * Add new diag_file_add and _remove API to the C TAP library.

rra-c-util 4.12 (2013-12-09)

    Fix a bug in the *_OPTIONAL version of all Autoconf macros using
    lib-helper.m4 that would add yes/include and yes/lib to the compiler
    and linker search paths.  Found by Julien ÉLIE.

    Add new RRA_LIB_SASL and RRA_LIB_SASL_OPTIONAL macros based on
    Autoconf macros in INN.  Contributed by Julien ÉLIE.  Currently, these
    only deal with Cyrus SASL, not GNU SASL.

    Provide KADM5_MISSING_KRB5_CONF_PARAMS in portable/kadmin.h for kadmin
    implementations that don't define it, such as Heimdal.

    Add test_tmpdir to Test::RRA::Automake.  This works the same as the
    corresponding function in the C and shell TAP libraries: it creates a
    temporary directory for tests to use, returns the path, and attempts
    to remove the directory when the process exits.

    Add an ignore rule to the valgrind suppression file for memory
    allocated by dlopen on Linux, which appears to be unavoidable and not
    freed on dlclose.

rra-c-util 4.11 (2013-11-14)

    RRA_LIB_KRB5 and RRA_LIB_KRB5_OPTIONAL now define HAVE_KRB5 instead of
    HAVE_KERBEROS and set rra_use_KRB5 instead of rra_use_kerberos, for
    consistency with other macros, with the macro names, and with the
    other shell variables those macros set.  All utility code, libraries,
    and tests included in rra-c-util have been updated accordingly.

    RRA_LIB_KRB5_OPTIONAL now correctly configures the package to not use
    Kerberos instead of failing if neither the new Kerberos error APIs nor
    libcom_err could be found.

    Don't require use of Automake when using the Kerberos Autoconf macros.
    The AM_CONDITIONAL for the use of com_err is now ignored if Automake
    is not in use.

    All _OPTIONAL m4 macros now set the corresponding rra_use_* shell
    variable to true if no explicit configure flags are given but the
    libraries are found at configure time, paralleling how the HAVE_* C
    preprocessor variables are defined.

    RRA_LIB_OPENSSL and RRA_LIB_OPENSSL_OPTIONAL now define HAVE_OPENSSL
    instead of HAVE_SSL if the library is found to make the define
    consistent with the macro names and shell variables.

    RRA_LIB_OPENSSL_OPTIONAL no longer aborts if libcrypto could not be
    found, and both it and RRA_LIB_OPENSSL now properly restore the
    default CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LIBS after probing for the libraries.
    Patch from Julien ÉLIE.

    RRA_LIB_OPENSSL and RRA_LIB_OPENSSL_OPTIONAL now probe for -ldl first
    and add it to the dependency libraries unless --enable-reduced-depends
    is given.  This is required to link with OpenSSL on AIX.  Reported by
    Julien ÉLIE.

    In xasprintf and xvasprintf, distinguish between failure to allocate
    memory and failure to format the output.  Report the latter by passing
    0 to the failure handler, and special-case that in the default failure
    handler to report a different error message.

    Check the return status of snprintf when converting port numbers to
    strings in network_bind_all and network_connect_host, and use the
    correct format for the port number for the latter.

    Check the return status of vsnprintf in the syslog message handlers
    for die, warn, and friends, and report an error with warn if vsnprintf
    fails.

    In the vasprintf replacement, preserve errno if snprintf fails when
    formatting the string into the newly-allocated buffer.

    Check the return status of snprintf in the getnameinfo and inet_ntop
    replacement functions instead of assuming that it will always succeed.

    portable/socket.h now defines EAI_ADDRFAMILY to EAI_FAMILY if it's not
    defined to let code compare against this obsolete error code
    unconditionally.  Some older systems may have an EAI_ADDRFAMILY error
    code distinct from EAI_FAMILY.

    Update to C TAP Harness 2.3:

    * Add new test_cleanup_register API to the C TAP library.
    * Suppress lazy plans and test summaries if the test failed with bail.
    * Add warn_unused_result gcc attributes to relevant functions.

rra-c-util 4.10 (2013-10-04)

    Add Autoconf macros for finding build flags for the TinyCDB library.

    The Autoconf macros for probing for the OpenSSL libraries have been
    renamed to RRA_LIB_OPENSSL instead of RRA_LIB_SSL, and all the
    substitution variables have similarly been changed.  The m4 file is
    now openssl.m4 and depends on lib-helper.m4.  There is a new macro,
    RRA_LIB_OPENSSL_OPTIONAL, for packages with optional OpenSSL support.
    HAVE_SSL is now defined if the OpenSSL libraries were found.

    In the use_prereq function in Test::RRA, support version numbers
    containing underscores and report the required version number, if any,
    in the skip message printed if the test is skipped.

    Support a @STRICT_IGNORE variable in the perl.conf configuration file
    for the standard tests for Perl scripts.

    Include in portable/kadmin.h the header file defining kadmin error
    codes, add a probe for one of the two possible namings for that file,
    and adjust for the missing KADM5_PASS_Q_GENERIC error code in Heimdal.

    Replace krb5_free_default_realm with krb5_xfree on Heimdal, not free.

    Add the appropriate gcc attribute to avoid leaking the dummy symbol
    used to keep the portability library from being empty when it is
    included in a shared object.

rra-c-util 4.9 (2013-08-14)

    Add support for k_pioctl to the portability layer for libkafs by
    providing a fallback to lpioctl when using the AFS libraries and a
    system call failure define if no library was found.

    Prototype the libkafs functions if the library was found but no header
    file was since some AFS builds don't provide headers.

    Improve the standard Perl tests to check POD under examples, usr/bin,
    and usr/sbin directories, not check SYNOPSIS sections for scripts,
    work correctly with packages missing Build.PL or a t directory, and
    also check style in files under a usr directory.

    network_connect, when given a timeout, now resumes waiting for the
    nonblocking connect after being interrupted by a signal.  This can
    mean that a connect can take longer than the timeout if interrupted;
    hopefully both timeouts and catching signals are rare enough that this
    won't pose a serious issue.

    Increase buffer sizes in the network timeout test to work properly
    with newer Linux kernels.

    The PCRE Autoconf probe macros now correctly handle the case where the
    PCRE library exists but its header file does not, such as on Mac OS X.

    Add new tests/perl/module-version-t test for packages that have
    embedded Perl modules.  This checks that the embedded Perl module
    versions match the package version and can optionally update all of
    the version numbers.

    Update to C TAP Harness 2.2:

    * bail and sysbail now exit with status 255 to match Test::More.

rra-c-util 4.8 (2013-03-15)

    Add new Test::RRA, Test::RRA::Automake, and Test::RRA::Config Perl
    modules collecting useful utility functions for tests written in Perl
    in packages that use the rra-c-util layout and structure.  The tests
    in tests/docs and tests/perl now use these libraries, so packages
    using those test scripts should also include the tests/tap/perl
    directory in the distribution.

    The tests/perl/critic-t and tests/perl/minimum-version-t tests now use
    tests/data/perl.conf for per-package configuration, making it easier
    to use the tests verbatim in multiple packages with different ignore
    lists or minimum version requirements.

    The tests/perl/strict-t test now works properly for Perl scripts that
    make use of a Perl module that's built as part of the larger package
    build.

    The Perl tests now more correctly handle testing of packages when the
    build directory is a subdirectory of the source directory.

    Update the perlcritic and perltidy configuration used for checking
    Perl coding style to match the current Stanford Perl coding style.

    Add a new perl/t directory that contains generic test programs
    suitable for standalone Perl modules or for projects that embed a Perl
    module build inside the project.

    All C code in the package now cleanly passes clang --analyze with
    clang 3.0.

    Update to C TAP Harness 2.1:

    * runtests now treats the command line as a list of tests by default.
    * The full test executable path can now be passed to runtests -o.
    * Improved harness output for tests with lazy plans.
    * Improved harness output to a terminal for some abort cases.
    * Flush harness output after each test even when not on a terminal.

rra-c-util 4.7 (2012-12-19)

    Add new portability wrapper for sys/statvfs.h that converts statvfs
    code to statfs code for older systems.

    When probing for Heimdal's libroken, probe for roken_concat (present
    since at least Heimdal 0.4) instead of rk_simple_execve (not present
    until Heimdal 1.3).

    portable/apr.h now includes apr_errno.h, apr_file_info.h, and
    apr_file_io.h and handles backwards compatibility of the APR_FOPEN_*
    flags and APR_FPROT_* constants to APR 0.9.

    Probe for Kerberos headers using file existence checks instead of the
    compiler if a Kerberos root or include path was given.  Otherwise, the
    compiler may find the wrong header in the system default include path
    and incorrectly assume krb5.h should be used instead of krb5/krb5.h.

    Update tests/docs/pod-t and tests/docs/pod-spelling-t to use
    File::Spec rather than assuming UNIX paths, use Test::Spelling instead
    of hand-rolling its functionality, ignore .git and perl directories,
    and use my current Perl coding style.  These tests are now more
    suitable for copying into other packages.

    Add new generic tests for packages containing Perl:
    tests/perl/critic-t, tests/perl/minimum-version-t, and
    tests/perl/strict-t.  Add configuration for perlcritic and perltidy
    for use with the test suite to tests/data.  The minimum version test
    may require some configuration when copied into another package.

    Add a valgrind suppression file in tests/data that is suitable for
    other projects using rra-c-util, particularly ones using Kerberos.

rra-c-util 4.6 (2012-09-17)

    Drop concat and concatpath from the util library.  asprintf or
    xasprintf, provided by the portability and util libraries
    respectively, are entirely superior alternatives to concat.
    concatpath was only used in INN and will be reintroduced if I end up
    using it in my other software.

    xasprintf and xvasprintf (in the util library) and basprintf and
    bvasprintf (in the TAP add-on) are now void functions and always call
    the xmalloc failure handler on any error, not just on ENOMEM errors.
    The faint chance that the underlying asprintf function could return
    some other error isn't worth the additional code complexity of still
    having to check the return status and then probably abort anyway.

    Add POD documentation for xmalloc, xcalloc, and xrealloc.

    In the replacement kafs library, fix a compilation failure on Solaris
    11 or later.

    Add an RRA_INCLUDES_APACHE macro to m4/apache.m4 that can be used to
    include a basic set of Apache headers when probing for declarations
    relevant to Apache modules.

    Strip -g and -On flags from APACHE_CPPFLAGS as returned by apxs to
    avoid forcing debugging and optimization strategy for Apache modules.

rra-c-util 4.5 (2012-05-31)

    In the PAM utility library, cope with a NULL pam_args structure in
    putil_args_free and in EXIT logging to make handling of failure to
    allocate the pam_args structure simpler.

    Add KRB5_WELLKNOWN_NAME and KRB5_ANON_NAME to the Kerberos portability
    header, used to form the anonymous principal name.

    Add a replacement for krb5_free_string to the Kerberos portability
    header.

    In the PAM testing library, do not set a default value for the user
    but use the user member of the config struct without modification,
    even if it's NULL.  This allows testing of PAM calls where no user is
    set.

rra-c-util 4.4 (2012-05-11)

    In the PAM utility logging functions, do not include a colon, space,
    and the PAM error if the provided PAM status was PAM_SUCCESS.

    Add regular expression support to the PAM test library.  Both output
    lines and PAM prompts can now be extended regular expressions instead
    of strings, indicated by surrounding them with slashes (/), and the
    actual output or prompt will be matched against the regular
    expression.  If regular expression support is not available, the test
    will be skipped.

    Support for the %* wildcard in output in PAM test scripts has been
    removed.  Use regular expressions instead.

    The fakepam library now separates the priority from the log line when
    recording output from the PAM module instead of appending a string
    representation of the priority to the beginning of the output line.
    The layout of the output struct (returned by pam_output) has changed
    accordingly.

    In the PAM testing framework, don't copy the provided password into
    the PAM_AUTHTOK item.  Instead, take new configuration parameters
    authtok and oldauthtok that, if provided, are copied into the PAM data
    before running the script.  This allows separate testing of a saved
    password and a password provided at a prompt.  Document in the fakepam
    README file all of the possible configuration parameters.

    Various minor improvements to the scripted PAM testing framework: add
    PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL to the recognized PAM error codes, report output
    and prompt lines starting from 1 instead of 0, and report an error
    message rather than segfaulting if necessary parameters for a testing
    script are not provided.

    The RRA_KRB5_CONFIG helper macro for Kerberos library probes now
    checks whether --deps is supported by krb5-config and, if so, passes
    it in unless --enable-reduced-depends was passed to configure.  This
    will fix link issues on some platforms where all dependency libraries
    need to be linked to ensure proper behavior.

    RRA_LIB_GSSAPI and RRA_LIB_KRB5 have been modified to use
    RRA_KRB5_CONFIG instead of duplicating their own krb5-config logic.
    This includes picking up the above change to use --deps if available.
    If including m4/gssapi.m4 or m4/krb5.m4 in another package, one must
    now also copy m4/krb5-config.m4.

    RRA_LIB_GSSAPI no longer calls krb5-config with no arguments if the
    gssapi argument isn't supported and instead falls back to manual
    library probing.  This is only relevant for very old versions of
    Kerberos.

    In the Kerberos TAP add-on, fix cleanup handling of user password
    configuration and repeatedly-generated krb5.conf files.

    Avoid using local in the remctl.sh and kerberos.sh TAP libraries and
    instead use a tap_ prefix on variables, for portability to Solaris
    /bin/sh.  Also avoid using test_file_path or test_tmpdir in backquotes
    inside double quotes to avoid a quoting bug in Solaris /bin/sh.

    Make the __attribute__ handling in portable/macros.h more aware of
    different versions and compilers.  All attributes are now suppressed
    for GCC older than 2.96 (instead of 2.7), since __malloc__ became
    available then.  __alloc_size__ is suppressed for GCC older than 4.3.
    Warnings about unknown diagnostics are suppressed for LLVM and Clang,
    which pretend to be GCC but don't support all the same attributes.

    Fix several portability bugs in the network test suite.  Patch from
    Jeffrey Hutzelman.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.12:

    * Add UNUSED macro to tests/tap/macros.h for other TAP add-ons.
    * Suppress plan and summary if bail is called before any tests run.
    * Remove additional uses of local in tests/tap/libtap.sh.
    * Silence __attribute__ warnings on more compilers.

rra-c-util 4.3 (2012-04-26)

    Remove the bool arguments to buffer_sprintf and buffer_vsprintf and
    instead introduce new buffer_append_sprintf and _vsprintf functions to
    append to the buffer, which is what the functions did with a true
    argument.  This avoids having a bool argument to functions, the
    meaning of which is often obscure in the calling code.

    Probe for GSS-API headers using file existence checks instead of the
    compiler if a GSS-API root or include path was given.  Otherwise, the
    compiler may find the wrong header in the system default include path
    and incorrectly assume gssapi/gssapi.h should be used instead of
    gssapi.h.  Thanks to Jeffrey Hutzelman for the idea.

    Add a new RRA_INCLUDES_GSSAPI macro that can be used to get a set of
    standard includes when probing for GSS-API library features.

    Move the probes for GSS-API include files and OID definitions into
    RRA_LIB_GSSAPI, since there's no downside to always running them.

    Set rra_use_remctl to true in RRA_LIB_REMCTL_OPTIONAL if remctl
    libraries were found, following the documentation.

    Add parameter expansion support in the PAM options section to the PAM
    test script parser.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.11:

    * Only use feature-test macros when requested or built with gcc -ansi.
    * New tests/tap/macros.h header with some common definitions.
    * Drop is_double from the C TAP library to avoid requiring -lm.
    * Avoid using local in the shell libtap.sh library.

rra-c-util 4.2 (2012-02-29)

    Add new network_read and network_write functions to the network
    utility library, which read from and write to network sockets with an
    optional timeout.

    Fix replacement strndup function to not assume that the string being
    duplicated is nul-terminated.

    Avoid excessive memory allocation when duplicating short
    nul-terminated strings in xstrndup.

    Fix the skipped test counts in the network utility test suite for
    systems that don't have IPv6 configured.  Thanks, Felix Geyer.

    Add -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 to the default warning flags for more checks
    on glibc systems, and fix the resulting warnings in some of the test
    suite programs.

    Update the kerberos.sh and remctl.sh TAP add-ons for the new
    tests/config location of Kerberos configuration and to use test_tmpdir
    for temporary files.

    Add reading of Kerberos username and password configuration to
    kerberos_setup in the Kerberos TAP add-on and always return a struct
    of configuration.  Return the path to the keytab configuration and the
    corresponding principal, if present, and the principal, username,
    realm, and password from a password configuration, if present.
    Support requiring one or both configurations and calling skip_all if
    they're missing.  Remove the alternative implementation of the
    Kerberos utility functions that doesn't require the Kerberos libraries
    and instead use #ifdef inside the primary implementation to handle
    this.

    Significantly improve the remctl TAP add-on.  Get the path to remctld
    from a #define via Makefile.am rather than requiring all test programs
    pass it in.  Shut down remctld automatically at the end of the test
    suite to remove the requirement for explicit cleanup.  Take the
    Kerberos configuration struct from the new kerberos_setup function and
    get the required configuration information from it.  Add support for
    running remctld under fakeroot, and correctly handle shutting down
    remctld when run under fakeroot or valgrind.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.10:

    * Add bstrndup function to C TAP library.

rra-c-util 4.1 (2011-12-29)

    Remove Kerberos v4 portability code: Autoconf probes, the portability
    header, and the lifetime function replacements.  None of my packages
    support Kerberos v4 any more and I can no longer test this code.

    In the PAM utility library, when Kerberos support is available, fix
    initialization of time values in the module configuration on platforms
    (like S/390X) where krb5_deltat is not equivalent to long.

    Add a replacement for a missing krb5_cc_get_full_name function to the
    Kerberos portability layer.

rra-c-util 4.0 (2011-12-24)

    The fake PAM library for testing now also supports a script-driven
    test infrastructure that uses configuration files to specify the PAM
    options, calls, flags, return status, prompts, responses, and logging
    output and supports callbacks to check the PAM status before it's
    closed.  See tests/fakepam/README for more information.

    The fake PAM library now supports PAM_AUTHTOK, PAM_OLDAUTHTOK, and
    PAM_CONV items and more correctly implements the PAM environment.  It
    also supports intercepting getpwnam calls and returning a synthetic
    structure, and intercepting Kerberos krb5_kuserok calls and using the
    configured home directory to find .k5login.  Log output is now
    returned as an array of strings rather than concatenating all the
    messages together.  The fake PAM library now depends on the TAP
    library and uses its facilities for allocating memory so that memory
    allocation failures are reported with bail.

    Do not call krb5_get_error_message with a NULL context.  Older
    versions of Heimdal will dereference the context unconditionally and
    segfault.

    When logging the entrance to PAM functions in pam-util, convert flags
    into symbolic names.  Also close a memory leak in putil_log_failure
    and allow for systems where __func__ is defined by the system headers
    even though the compiler doesn't indicate a new enough C standard
    version (such as NetBSD).

    When overriding defaults during PAM option parsing in pam-util, free
    any memory allocated for the old settings.

    Add portable/pam.h support for PAM_EXTERN.

    In the Kerberos library probes, probe for both krb5.h and krb5/krb5.h
    and use the latter if the former isn't found.  Add an
    RRA_INCLUDES_KRB5 macro that expands into the headers to use for
    Kerberos probes.  This allows the header to be found on NetBSD
    systems.  Thanks to Fredrik Pettai for the report.

    Fix RRA_LIB_REMCTL_OPTIONAL to not define HAVE_REMCTL even if the
    library wasn't found and to clear the variables used in Makefiles if
    the library isn't found.

    Add a probe for Kerberos kadmin client libraries.  This uses a new
    framework for library probes (m4/lib-helper.m4 and m4/krb5-config.m4)
    that may eventually be used for the other library probes.  Add a
    portability wrapper around kadm5/admin.h and some example probes in
    configure.ac.

    Include config.h in stdbool.h unless it has already been included.

    Add new TAP library add-on that defines basprintf and bvasprintf,
    which wrap asprintf and vasprintf, checking their return status and
    calling bail if they fail.

    The kerberos_setup TAP utility function now expects a test keytab to
    be in tests/config/keytab instead of tests/data/test.keytab and uses
    tests/tmp for the temporary ticket cache.  It no longer needs the
    principal found in the keytab to be explicitly configured in
    tests/data/test.principal; instead, it reads the principal from the
    keytab.

    Add new Kerberos TAP utility functions bail_krb5 and diag_krb5 to
    append a Kerberos error message, kerberos_config_password to return
    Kerberos principal and password information from a file in
    tests/config, and kerberos_keytab_principal to return the first
    principal found in a keytab file (so that the user doesn't have to
    explicitly configure which principal to use once they've created the
    keytab)

    Add a kerberos_generate_conf TAP utility function to generate a
    krb5.conf file for testing.  The last supports changing the default
    realm, removing configuration that may interfere with what's being
    tested, and honoring a krb5.conf file put in tests/config.  It uses a
    helper program, generate-krb5-conf, which must be in tests/data.

    Add a Kerberos TAP utility function that uses the kadmin client
    library to set a password expiration time on a principal for software
    that needs to test behavior of expired passwords.

    Remove mkusage.  This idea turns out to not be as useful as it looked,
    and the package of mine that was previously using it no longer is.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.9:

    * Add test_tmpdir and test_tmpdir_free to TAP library.
    * runtests now frees all allocated resources on exit.

rra-c-util 3.11 (2011-12-01)

    In the network utility library, when a connection with a timeout
    concludes, properly store the recovered error code in errno where the
    caller can pick it up.  Fix some problems with the test suite for
    connect with timeout on systems where this cannot be tested by using a
    short listen queue.

    Add a portability wrapper around some common APR headers that provides
    macros missing from APR 0.9.

rra-c-util 3.10 (2011-10-31)

    Correctly handle empty vectors in vector_join and cvector_join.
    Thanks to Richard Kettlewell for the test suite addition.

    Fix the syntax of the typedefs for missing socklen_t and
    sig_atomic_t.  Patch from Matthew Loar.

    Provide ssize_t in portable/system.h if the system doesn't define it
    (Windows does not).  Requires an additional check in configure.ac for
    users of portable/system.h.  Patch from Matthew Loar.

    Fix the stripping of -I/usr/include from the output of krb5-config.
    The previous code used extended regular expressions, which cannot be
    relied on inside sed, and would have stripped include paths that start
    with /usr/include.  Just use two sed invocations, with and without a
    trailing space.  Thanks to Ken Dreyer for the report.

    Fix RRA_LIB_KRB5_OPTIONAL to make Kerberos libraries really optional
    when called without --enable-reduced-depends and without setting a
    path to the Kerberos libraries.

    Fix RRA_LIB_REMCTL_OPTIONAL to not require the remctl library be found
    when neither --with-remctl nor --without-remctl was given.

rra-c-util 3.9 (2011-09-23)

    The replacement for the Solaris and BSD function issetugid was
    mistakenly called issetuidgid instead, causing it to always be built.
    Use the correct function name so that the native function is used on
    platforms that provide it.

    Always include gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h in portable/gssapi.h if it's
    available.  Prefer gssapi/gssapi.h to gssapi.h in sample configure
    probes.

    Stop providing or using INADDR_LOOPBACK in the socket portability code
    and instead use htonl(0x7f000001UL).  The byte-order of
    INADDR_LOOPBACK appears to be undefined in practice, so neither using
    it directly nor using it with htonl works reliably.

    Use typedef instead of #define for defining socklen_t and sig_atomic_t
    if they're missing, following the recommendation in the Autoconf
    manual.

    The Kerberos test setup TAP extension now registers its cleanup
    function as an atexit handler so the caller doesn't need to explicitly
    clean up.  It also frees all allocated memory, including the returned
    principal and the stored environment variables, for cleaner valgrind
    analysis.

    In the kinit and shell versions of the Kerberos test setup TAP
    extension, try to suppress getting new AFS tokens in Heimdal so that
    the test doesn't override a user's existing tokens.

    Wait longer for remctld to start in the remctl setup TAP extension to
    allow time for running everything under valgrind.

rra-c-util 3.8 (2011-09-02)

    The network_connect utility functions now take an optional timeout.
    If non-zero, a non-blocking connect is done with that timeout, rather
    than blocking on connect until the TCP stack gives up.  The network
    utility code now depends on the fdflag code.

    Provide a function to free the results of network_bind_all.

    Add an implementation of fdflag_nonblocking for Windows and allow
    fdflag.c to be built on Windows.

    In the generic PAM option parser, add support for time configuration
    options.  If Kerberos is available, these have a type of krb5_deltat
    and are parsed using the Kerberos library routine to parse a time
    interval.  Without Kerberos, they fall back to longs and are parsed as
    numbers.

    Support pam_get_item and pam_set_item in the fake PAM library used for
    testing PAM modules.

    In the Autoconf Kerberos macros, avoid krb5-config and use manual
    library probing if either --with-krb5-include or --with-krb5-lib is
    given.  Similarly avoid use of krb5-config in the GSS-API Autoconf
    macros if --with-gssapi-include or --with-gssapi-lib are given.  One
    generally doesn't specify specific directories like that unless
    krb5-config will be wrong.

    Use PATH_KRB5_CONFIG as the environment variable to set the path to
    krb5-config rather than KRB5_CONFIG in all the Autoconf macros that
    use it (krb5.m4, gssapi.m4, and krb4.m4), since the latter is used by
    the Kerberos libraries to specify an alternative path to krb5.conf.

    Add replacement for krb5_verify_init_creds_opt_init, which is missing
    from the AIX NAS Kerberos implementation in at least some versions.

    Define the C preprocessor symbol HAVE_KERBEROS if RRA_LIB_KRB5 is
    used, rather than only if RRA_LIB_KRB5_OPTIONAL is used and Kerberos
    was found.  This simplifies reuse of code between mandatory-Kerberos
    and optional-Kerberos packages.

    Fix sample configure.ac probe for krb5_kt_free_entry prototype.

    Check for krb5_get_init_creds_opt_set_change_password_prompt,
    krb5_set_password, and krb5_get_init_creds_opt_set_pkinit, replacing
    them as needed, and add new Autoconf macros to handle old
    nine-argument forms of the latter.

    Add RRA_LIB_REMCTL_OPTIONAL to m4/remctl.m4 for packages where the
    remctl dependency is not required.  Define HAVE_REMCTL if remctl is
    present, including when using the non-optional macro.

    Improve the is_function_output TAP add-on interface to take an opaque
    data pointer and pass it into the called function.

    Add a new run_setup TAP add-on function that runs a given command and
    calls bail if it fails, used for doing test setup in an external
    command.  (Some things are easier to do in shell than in C.)

    Define some macros missing from Solaris PAM in portable/pam.h.

    Change Kerberos v5 to just Kerberos in various files.  Version 5 has
    been the default version of Kerberos for over a decade.

    Fix use of long long in portable/mkstemp.c.

    Make the getaddrinfo replacement portable to systems that don't
    declare h_errno and don't define the netdb.h error constants.

    Fix argument type for network_bind_all on Windows.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.8:

    * Add bmalloc, bcalloc, brealloc, and bstrdup TAP library functions.
    * Fix runtests to honor -s even if BUILD and -b aren't given.

rra-c-util 3.7 (2011-07-25)

    Add a new set of utility functions for managing a data buffer.  A
    buffer dynamically resizes and has a concept of used and unused data,
    making it suitable for buffering and processing data from an input
    stream.  It has associated functions for adding data to the buffer in
    various ways.  Taken from work Russ Allbery did for INN's library,
    based on buffer code originally found in innd.

    Add Autoconf macros for finding build flags for the APR and APR-Util
    libraries.

    Fix error handling when krb5_appdefault_string returns without setting
    the result string.  Fixes a possible segfault during configuration
    parsing on Mac OS X 10.7.

    Abort during configure if building the replacement kafs library on a
    platform that uses regular system calls and afs/param.h is not found.
    The system call interface can't be built without the AFS headers, and
    it's better to fail with a descriptive message at configure time than
    with an obscure message at compile time.

    Include strings.h in portable/system.h if it exists.  Some platforms,
    such as FreeBSD, follow POSIX closely and only define strncasecmp
    here.

    Add ARRAY_SIZE and ARRAY_END macros to util/macros.h.

    Prefer gssapi/gssapi.h to gssapi.h in portable/gssapi.h.  On FreeBSD,
    gssapi.h is marked as deprecated and emits a warning.

    Fix compiler warning in util/messages.c when printing an error about
    failed memory allocation.

    Fix detection of whether the PAM API uses const on FreeBSD.  Thanks to
    Julien ÉLIE for the report and testing.

    When building rra-c-util itself, only build kafs support if
    --enable-kafs is passed to configure.  This avoids having rra-c-util
    fail to build on platforms that require the OpenAFS headers or
    libraries when AFS is not installed.

    Add a pointer to rra-c-util to all files meant to be copied into other
    software packages.

rra-c-util 3.6 (2011-06-07)

    Fix error handling in network_accept_any if select returns with no
    error but without setting any of the sockets as ready.  This should be
    a rare edge case.

    Fix pam_getenvlist in the fakepam testing library to return an empty
    environment instead of NULL when no environment variables have been
    set.

rra-c-util 3.5 (2011-05-31)

    When binding an IPv6-only socket with network_bind_ipv6 and not
    binding to all local addresses, use IP_FREEBIND if it's available.
    This allows binding to addresses that are not yet configured, which is
    much more common with IPv6 given IPv6 autoconfiguration.

    Add new network_accept_any() function, which takes an array of file
    descriptors (similar to what's returned by network_bind_all) and
    blocks accepting incoming connections on any of those file
    descriptors.

    Skip portable/getaddrinfo test on systems where invalid hostnames
    still resolve.

    The remctld_start() function of the TAP remctl add-on now takes
    optional additional arguments to remctld.

rra-c-util 3.4 (2011-05-05)

    The gssapi.m4 fix for Heimdal without libroken was incomplete.  It now
    doesn't attempt to link with libroken when probing for GSS-API
    symbols.  Thanks, Antoine Verheijen.

    Update GCC warning flags for make warnings to 4.6.1, adding
    -Wjump-misses-init, -Wlogical-op, and -Wredundant-decls.

    Remove an unused variable in snprintf testing and properly check the
    return status of xasprintf and xvasprintf.

    Add casts to the pam-util library in places where signed to unsigned
    conversions have been confirmed to not be bugs, in preparation for
    using -Wconversion.  This warning flag is still unused by default due
    a bug in handling htons.

rra-c-util 3.3 (2011-04-28)

    When binding IPv6 sockets, restrict them to only IPv6 connections
    rather than also allowing IPv4 connections where possible.  The
    default behavior, for maximum backward compatibility, is for
    IPv6-bound sockets to accept IPv4 connections and expose those
    connections as IPv4 mapped addresses.  This causes various problems,
    however, such as with reuse of bound ports (which was causing test
    suite failures) and requirements to handle IPv4 mapped addresses.  The
    network model (also used by BSD systems) where IPv6 sockets only
    accept IPv6 connections is cleaner, even if it requires juggling
    multiple sockets in some situations.

    The gssapi.m4 Autoconf macros now handle the bundled Heimdal on
    OpenBSD that doesn't have a separate libroken.  Thanks to Antoine
    Verheijen for the analysis.

    Define the KRB5_USES_COM_ERR Automake conditional to false when
    --without-krb5 is used rather than leaving it undefined, since the
    latter can cause configure failures.  Patch from Andrew Deason.

    Fix underquoting in m4/socket.m4.

    Add a test of krb5_realm to configure.ac so that pam-util will compile
    with Heimdal.  Also fix kafs compilation flags to build properly with
    Heimdal kafs if it's in a non-standard path.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.7:

    * Add more complete usage message and -h option to runtests.

rra-c-util 3.2 (2011-03-03)

    In the strndup replacement, check if the string being duplicated is
    NULL, and if so, return NULL and set errno to EINVAL rather than
    segfaulting.  Thanks, Carsten Hey.

    Zero sockaddr_in and sockaddr_in6 in the network library before using
    one, just in case non-zeroed padding bytes might cause problems.
    Thanks, Bo Lindbergh.

rra-c-util 3.1 (2011-01-23)

    Add a replacement for a missing strndup (not available on Mac OS X).

    Fix compilation of the embedded kafs layer for Mac OS X 10.6 and
    hopefully fix detection of whether AFS is present.  Thanks, Andy
    Cobaugh.

    Add vector_copy, vector_exec, and vector_exec_env to the pam-util
    vector library.  Fix vector_clear to not attempt to free strings that
    are NULL.  Fix broken GCC attribute markers on the pam-util vector
    library, which could cause compilation problems with non-GCC
    compilers.

    Add a new type of configuration parameter to the pam-util option
    parser that stores a vector but takes its default value as a string
    (which will be split the way that a PAM option setting would be
    split).

    When probing for Kerberos libraries, always add any supplemental
    libraries found to that point to the link command.  This will fix
    configure failures on platforms without working transitive shared
    library dependencies.

    When probing for <ibm_svc/krb5_svc.h> (part of AIX's bundled Kerberos
    implementation), include <krb5.h> before attempting to include that
    header to quiet confusing Autoconf warnings.  Reported by Wilfried
    Weiss.

    Add explicit license statements to the files meant to be copied into
    other packages rather than referring to LICENSE.

rra-c-util 3.0 (2010-12-29)

    Add a PAM utility library to assist in developing PAM modules.  This
    utility library provides functions for logging and table-driven option
    parsing, including reading options from krb5.conf.  It also provides a
    version of the util/vector.c library that doesn't die on memory
    allocation failure and hence is suitable for use in PAM modules.

    Add a fake PAM library used for testing PAM modules.  This fake PAM
    library provides just enough of the PAM library functionality to make
    PAM module function calls into a single module, but doesn't look at
    the system-wide configuration, allowing PAM modules to be more easily
    tested without changes to the system configuration.  It also allows
    test programs to inspect the internals of the PAM state.

    Add untested support for the ioctl AFS system call methods on Mac OS X
    and Solaris 11 to the kafs replacement library.

    Add a replacement for k_haspag for use with either the kafs
    replacement library or for systems with a libkafs or libkopenafs that
    don't have that function.

    Export k_pioctl from the kafs replacement library and provide a
    definition of struct ViceIoctl.  This is mainly for the use of
    k_haspag, but may prove useful for making other AFS system calls.

    Move kafs/kafs.h to portable/kafs.h, since it's more a portability
    header than a header solely for the kafs replacement library.

    Fix the --with-libkafs-lib and --with-libkafs-include configure
    options to work properly.

    Properly include prerequisite Kerberos and ioctl headers before
    including the Heimdal kafs.h header.

    Add handling of krb5_free_default_realm and krb5_init_secure_context
    to the Kerberos portability layer.

    Add a replacement for missing krb5_appdefault_* functions for
    compatibility with AIX's included Kerberos, which provides the profile
    library but not the Kerberos interface to query it.

    Fix broken GCC attribute markers causing problems with compilation on
    Windows (and likely any non-GCC compiler).

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.6:

    * Better error handling if BUILD or SOURCE aren't set.
    * Flush standard error before results in the C TAP library.
    * Improve test failure output formatting in some edge cases.

rra-c-util 2.7 (2010-09-20)

    For Kerberos and GSS-API checks, look for krb5-config in
    /usr/kerberos/bin after checking the user's PATH.  This is the default
    location on Red Hat Enterprise prior to RHEL6.

    Enable all configure logic in configure.ac that was previously
    commented out so that it is tested when building rra-c-util.  Building
    this package directly will now require working GSS-API libraries, but
    since it already required working Kerberos libraries, this should not
    make a noticeable difference.

rra-c-util 2.6 (2010-08-25)

    Add portability code for old MIT Kerberos and Heimdal libraries
    without krb5_get_init_creds_opt_free.

    When probing for Apache module build flags, call apr-config --includes
    and add it to the preprocessor flags.  Fixes build failures on Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

    When probing for UNIX domain sockets, include <sys/types.h> before
    <sys/socket.h> so that the test program compiles on OpenBSD.  Thanks,
    Wim Lewis.

    Add new test library function ktutil_list to output details of the
    contents of a keytab, used to compare two keytabs.

    Fix determination of the test principal in the kerberos.sh and
    remctl.sh test libraries.

    Properly include the Apache, cURL, OpenLDAP, OpenSSL, PCRE, and ld
    --version-script M4 checks in the distribution.

rra-c-util 2.5 (2010-07-07)

    Add an Autoconf macro set to locate the compiler and linker flags for
    Apache modules, allowing those modules to be built without using apxs
    to do the compilation and linking.

    Add Autoconf macros for detecting cURL, OpenLDAP, and OpenSSL
    libraries.

    Add an Autoconf macro that checks whether the linker supports the
    --version-script flag with a simple version script that just assigns
    symbol versions and marks some symbols as local.

    Add vector_split_multi and cvector_split_multi functions to
    util/vector.h, which split a string into a vector using any character
    found in a string of separators as a separator.

    Add a replacement for the Solaris issetuidgid function.

    Add Kerberos portability glue for krb5_data_free versus
    krb5_free_data_contents and improve checking for krb5_kt_free_entry
    with older versions of MIT Kerberos.

    The krb5.m4 Autoconf macros now handle the bundled Heimdal on OpenBSD
    that doesn't have a separate libroken.  If KRB5_CPPFLAGS,
    KRB5_LDFLAGS, or KRB5_LIBS are set before calling the macro, their
    values will be preserved and added to whatever the macro sets, which
    allows the caller to set up custom values for particular operating
    systems.

    Restore the default CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LIBS after probing for
    GSS-API libraries with --enable-reduced-depends.  Previously, the
    default variables were left containing extra GSS-API-specific flags.

    Allow users to suppress including config.h in portable/krb5.h so that
    the Kerberos portability code can be used in situations where a
    stripped-down config.h is needed, such as Apache modules.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.4:

    * Add tests/HOWTO from docs/writing-tests in C TAP Harness.
    * Add okv and test_file_path functions to the basic TAP library.
    * Use test_file_path in kerberos_setup, kerberos.sh, and remctl.sh.

rra-c-util 2.4 (2010-04-22)

    Add Autoconf macros to probe for the PCRE library, using pcre-config
    where possible and falling back on direct probing.

    Fix definition of replacement krb5_free_error_message to not be
    static.

    Fix header guard for util/xwrite.h.  Previously, the header would be
    incorrectly skipped if util/xmalloc.h was already included.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.2:

    * Add diag and sysdiag functions to the basic TAP library.
    * Clean up data types in the basic C TAP library.
    * Add the GCC nonnull attribute to the TAP library bail functions.

rra-c-util 2.3 (2010-02-15)

    Add a portability layer for the Kerberos API, which supplies something
    close to the Heimdal Kerberos API on either MIT or Heimdal and adjusts
    with functions missing from older versions.  Use it in the Kerberos
    TAP test module.

    Add die and warn wrappers for Kerberos errors to the utility library.

    Add a portability wrapper around PAM libraries and replacements for
    pam_syslog and pam_vsyslog, and an Autoconf macro to determine whether
    the PAM library headers use const.

    Add a new TAP add-on for running a function in a separate process and
    then checking its exit status and output.

    Disable the xmalloc test except for maintainers.  It's too fragile,
    and isn't catching problems with xmalloc itself.

    Adjust the Kerberos TAP test library add-ons for the split of
    util/util.h.

rra-c-util 2.2 (2010-01-18)

    Break util/util.h apart into separate header files for every utility
    function grouping.  This requires include changes in all packages
    importing rra-c-util, but makes it much easier to update header file
    changes for only those components that a downstream package users.

    Add the GCC function attributes alloc_size, malloc, and nonnull to the
    prototypes for utility functions where appropriate, and add the format
    attribute to xasprintf.

    kafs/kafs.h now defines HAVE_KAFS if any form of AFS support is
    available.  This allows programs using it to, for instance, display
    different help output based on whether AFS support is compiled in (as
    opposed to available on the current system, which is what k_hasafs
    determines).

    Improve error handling when network_connect or network_client_create
    are called with an unknown address domain for the source address.

    Switch to AC_TYPE_LONG_LONG_INT instead of AC_CHECK_TYPES([long long])
    as provided by newer Autoconfs, and change the snprintf replacement to
    assume the compiler provides long double.

    Remove unnecessary dependencies on the util library in the portable
    test suite.

rra-c-util 2.1 (2009-11-25)

    Add a new Autoconf macro, RRA_SET_LIBDIR, which sets the libdir
    variable based on the size of an integer in the compilation
    environment and whether /usr/lib32 or /usr/lib64 exist.

    Use a socket_type typedef rather than int directly to store the file
    descriptors of sockets and, on Windows, typedef that to SOCKET instead
    of int.  Update the function signatures of the network utility
    functions appropriately.  Compare socket_type variables against an
    INVALID_SOCKET define instead of -1.  Fixes portability issues to
    64-bit Windows.  Thanks, Jeffrey Altman.

    Add a cast to the log handler for Windows so that it works properly on
    64-bit Windows.  Thanks, Jeffrey Altman.

rra-c-util 2.0 (2009-08-15)

    Add a replacement for the libkafs library for AFS PAG and token
    manipulation.  This is a minimal version of the library with no
    external dependencies on Linux and only minimal AFS dependencies on
    other platforms that implements just enough of libkafs functionality
    to support pam-afs-session and kstart.  This is a somewhat-modified
    version of the kafs replacement files in kstart 3.14 that uses a
    separate library directory and Automake conditionals rather than
    AC_LIBOBJ and the portable directory and supports more specific
    configure options.

    Revert the separation of the message functions that call exit into a
    separate source file.  Unfortunately, even as a separate source file,
    it's still linked into shared libraries, so the additional code
    duplication isn't worth it.

    Add a replacement for mkstemp on systems that don't have it.

    If krb5-config produces results that don't work for Kerberos v5 of
    GSS-API probes, fall back on manual library probing rather than just
    failing.  This fixes problems with GSS-API probes on Solaris where
    krb5-config is present but doesn't know about GSS-API.  Thanks to Andy
    Cobaugh for the report.

    Suppress error output from krb5-config in Kerberos v5 and GSS-API
    probes so that it's not mixed in with configure output.

    Do not try to use a non-executable krb5-config for GSS-API probes and
    prefer the KRB5_CONFIG environment variable over a path constructed
    from the --with-gssapi argument.

    Add m4/krb4.m4, which probes for Kerberos v4 libraries in the same
    ways that m4/krb5.m4 probes for Kerberos v5 libraries.

    Add a portability wrapper around Kerberos v4 headers and replacements
    for Kerberos v4 lifetime functions for implementations that don't have
    them.

    Add m4/socket-unix.m4, which contains some probes for UNIX domain
    socket support taken from INN with modifications by Julien ÉLIE.

    RRA_SET_LDFLAGS (m4/lib-pathname.m4) now appends to the variable
    rather than only setting it and takes an optional third argument
    naming a subdirectory of the library directory to add to the library
    search path.

    Enable GCC format string checking for the replacement asprintf
    function.

    Use AS_HELP_STRING instead of the deprecated AC_HELP_STRING in all
    Autoconf m4 files.

    Fix network test suite failures when IPv6 is available but disabled
    in the kernel.

    Enable Automake silent rules.  For a quieter build, pass the
    --enable-silent-rules option to configure or build with make V=0.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.1:

    * Summarize results at the end of test executions.
    * Consume all output from a test case before closing its descriptor.

rra-c-util 1.0 (2009-05-22)

    Initial public release based on the portability code that shipped with
    remctl 2.13 with some additional files from other current releases of
    my software packages.  The changes below are relative to that version.

    Separate out the message functions that call exit to a separate source
    file and therefore a separate object file.  This will mean that shared
    libraries that don't call die won't link this file and hence won't
    include a reference to exit, which will avoid errors from some package
    test tools.

    Add a vector_addn function that adds a counted string to a vector
    (similar to strndup).  There is no cvector equivalent.

    On BSD/OS, despite the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag being present in the system
    headers, passing it into getaddrinfo results in an error.  Test for
    this at configure time and, if it doesn't work, hide the system
    AI_ADDRCONFIG definition.

    Remove RRA_LIB_*_SET functions.  When using Automake, one should never
    put one's own flags into the CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, and LDFLAGS variables,
    since the user may override them.  Instead, AM_* versions should be
    set in Makefile.am.  This can be done using the existing substitution
    variables, so the *_SET functions were always wrong.

    Declare message_fatal_cleanup extern in util.h.  Fixes compilation
    problems on Mac OS X and probably elsewhere.

    Update GSS-API probes for portability to Solaris 10's native generic
    GSS-API libraries.  Thanks, Peter Eriksson.

    Change from AC_TRY_* to AC_*_IFELSE for all Autoconf macros.

    Update the example configure.ac for Autoconf 2.63, adding
    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR and using AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS instead of
    AC_AIX and AC_GNU_SOURCE.

    Specify a mode when creating a sentinel in the daemon test.  This
    fixes compiler warnings with newer gcc.

    Updated test suite to the current version of C TAP Harness and its C
    TAP library.  Rewrite the extra functions that were in libtest as
    add-ons to the TAP library.

    Add a TAP test library Kerberos initialization function to use the
    native Kerberos library functions as well as a version that calls
    kinit.  The former will be more useful for packages that already
    depend on the Kerberos libraries.

    Add TAP test library functions to clean up the Kerberos ticket cache
    and to cleanly shut down remctld.

    Add TAP shell libraries for initializing Kerberos and starting and
    stopping remctld.

    Make the xmalloc test suite robust against builddir != srcdir builds
    that change the default file name of the test program.
