### New features

- Add support for `__fd_arg__`, `__fd_arg_read__`, and `__fd_arg_write__` macros to `portable/macros.h`.
- Tag file descriptor arguments to the utility library functions, other than sockets, with the appropriate `__fd_arg*__` attribute. Socket arguments are not (yet) tagged because they are not file descriptors on Windows systems.
