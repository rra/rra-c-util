### Bug fixes

- Do not unlink the file and then write to it in the mkstemp replacement test suite, since this fails on some file systems. This is not ideal since the calling program may be relying on traditional UNIX file semantics, but it can be addressed by moving temporary files to another file system and doesn't indicate a bug in the replacement function. Thanks to Julien Ã‰LIE for the report.
