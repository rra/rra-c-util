### New features

- All Autoconf macros that detect libraries now use `-isystem` instead of `-I` for the include paths. This tells the compiler to suppress warnings for constructions in the headers by treating them as system headers.

### Bug fixes

- Use `python-config` to find link flags if it is available, since this produces more correct results. Remove `LOCALMODLIBS` from the requested flags, since it is not necessary and breaks the build with newer Python versions.
