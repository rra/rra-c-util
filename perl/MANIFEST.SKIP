# MYMETA.json and MYMETA.yml are intentionally not ignored because otherwise
# Test::Kwalitee fails (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=143514).
# They will be added back in by Module::Build during ./Build manifest, and
# have to (unfortunately) be removed by hand.
#
# This is not entirely correct, since they should indeed be ignored when
# creating the distribution, but it happens to work for me.  See the bug for
# more details.
